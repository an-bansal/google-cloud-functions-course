## Starting a Project
To start a new project in Google cloud, we can go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)  or create it from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) 
## Creating a Python Virtual Environment
Did not perform following block on my laptop

    # First we have to install `python3-venv` with following command
        sudo apt install python3-venv
    # Then we execute following command
        py -m venv venv

or Enable virtual environment from within Pycharm.

See, [Configure a virtual environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)
